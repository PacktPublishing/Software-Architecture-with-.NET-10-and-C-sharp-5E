## About the book

Software Architecture with .NET 10 and C# puts high-level design theory to work in a modern .NET context, teaching you the key skills, technologies, and best practices required to become an effective .NET software architect.

This fifth edition brings you up to date with the latest advances in .NET 10 and modern C# language features. You'll learn how to choose between different architectures and technologies at each level of the stack. The book takes an even closer look at cloud-native patterns, distributed systems, and modern observability practices.

Divided into three parts, this book starts with the fundamentals of software architecture, covering C# best practices, software domains, design patterns, DevOps principles for CI/CD, and more. The second part focuses on the technologies, from choosing data storage in the cloud to implementing frontend microservices and working with Serverless. You'll learn about the main communication technologies used in microservices, such as REST API, gRPC, Azure Service Bus, and RabbitMQ. The final part takes you through real-world case studies where you'll apply software architecture principles to practical scenarios.

By the end of this book, you will be able to transform user requirements into technical needs and deliver highly scalable enterprise software architectures.
